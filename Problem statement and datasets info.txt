Problem Statement and Dataset Information

Problem Statement:
The goal of this project is to develop an automated system for classifying different types of electronic waste (e-waste). Accurate classification is a critical first step in efficient e-waste recycling processes. This project utilizes Deep Learning, specifically Transfer Learning with the EfficientNetV2B0 model, to categorize images of e-waste into ten distinct classes. The final model is deployed via a Gradio web interface to allow for easy, real-time image classification by users.
Dataset Information:
The model is trained on the "E-waste Image Dataset" (sourced from Kaggle: akshat103/e-waste-image-dataset).
Classes: The dataset contains images spanning 10 distinct categories of e-waste: Battery, Keyboard, Microwave, Mobile, Mouse, PCB (Printed Circuit Board), Player, Printer, Television, and Washing Machine.
Structure: The data is pre-split into three subsets:
Training Set: Used to teach the model to recognize patterns.
Validation Set: Used during training to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.
Test Set: Used after training to evaluate the final model's unbiased performance.
Preprocessing: All images are resized to 128x128 pixels before being fed into the model.
Augmentation: To improve model robustness, the training data undergoes random augmentations, including horizontal flips, slight rotations (up to 10%), and random zooms (up to 10%).
