Project Brief: The "Land Monitor"

1. Problem Statement

Context: Monitoring Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) change is a cornerstone of sustainable development, essential for tracking deforestation, managing urban sprawl, and assessing climate change impacts. While global datasets and platforms like Google Earth provide powerful visualization tools, a significant gap exists for non-expert users.

Problem: Publicly available information is often in the form of static, large-scale reports (e.g., "Amazon deforestation") or visual-only time-lapses (e.g., Google Earth's slider). These tools are not designed to provide on-demand, quantitative analysis for a specific, user-defined local area.

The Gap: A local planner, journalist, or concerned citizen cannot simply draw a box around a new construction site and instantly receive a quantifiable answer to the questions:

1.  What percentage of this area was "Forest" last year, and what is it today?
2.  How many acres of "Agricultural Land" have been lost in this specific district since 2018?
3.  Is this new "Urban" development occurring within a known "Flood Risk Zone" or a "Protected Conservation Area"?

Proposed Solution: This project aims to develop an interactive web tool, the "Land Monitor," to bridge this gap. By integrating a custom-trained, multispectral CNN model with live satellite APIs and public context layers, this application will empower any user to perform on-demand, quantitative, and contextual sustainability analysis for any location on Earth.

2. Datasets and APIs

This project will use a combination of one static training dataset and three live data services.

2.1. Core Model Training (Static Dataset)

Name: EuroSAT (Multispectral & RGB versions)
Purpose: The primary dataset of 27,000 labeled images used to train our core CNN model.
Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/apollo2506/eurosat-dataset
Access: Public domain. No registration required.

2.2. Live Satellite Imagery (API)

Name: Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem (Sentinel Hub)
Purpose: Provides the live, real-time satellite imagery for our application's "What's Here?" and "What's Changed?" features.
Link: https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/
Access: Requires a free, non-commercial user registration to obtain an API key (Client ID & Secret).

2.3. Context Layer 1: Protected Areas (API)

Name: Protected Planet API (from WDPA)
Purpose: Provides a live data layer to check if a selected area is inside a national park or other protected conservation area.
Link: https://api.protectedplanet.net/request
Access: Requires a free, non-commercial API token request (automated).

2.4. Context Layer 2: Flood Zones (WMS)

Name: FEMA National Flood Hazard Layer (NFHL)
Purpose: Provides a live map layer (WMS) to check if a selected area is within a known flood-risk zone.
Link (WMS URL): https://hazards.fema.gov/gis/nfhl/rest/services/public/NFHL/MapServer
Access: Public service. No key or registration required. The URL is used directly in the mapping code.
